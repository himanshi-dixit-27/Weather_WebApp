# Weather_WebApp

This is a web application that pulls data from https://openweathermap.org/.
It takes the weather data using an API key and renders it using
json objects.
Just enter the name of the city to find out the current temperature
and the range of temperature for the current day.
It also mentions the country, date and the weather type (smoke, cloudy, rainy, sunny, fog).
